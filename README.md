# 🧠 Web Quiz Engine (Java, Spring & MySQL)

## This project is a lightweight, interactive web-based quiz engine that allows users to generate customized questions, logical puzzles, web quests, or online tests. 
Users can create quiz templates, populate them with questions and answers, publish the quiz, and share it with others to take and view their final results.

## ✨ Main Features
* Create custom, web-based quizzes.
* Edit existing quizzes to add or modify questions.
* Specify the correct answer and logic for each question.
* Securely share quizzes with other users and allow them to submit answers.
* Calculate the overall score and statistcs for a specific quiz.

## ⚙️ Core Engineering Challenges
* **Dynamic Question Rendering:** Automatically loads questions based on the configuration or display preferences set by the creator.
* **Real-Time Scoring:** Calculates and displays the user's score instantly at the end of the quiz.
* **Customizable Quiz Banks:** Easily add new questions, hints, and answers during or after creation.
* **Responsive Design:** Works smoothly on both desktop and mobile browsers.
* **Role Management:** Quiz Creators can only access, modify, or delete the quizzes they created. Quiz Takers can only answer quizzes they have been explicitly granted access to.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** HTML, Bootstrap, React
* **Backend:** Java, Spring Boot, Spring Security
* **Database:** MySQL
* **Deployment:** Docker
  
### Prerequisites
Make sure you have **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed on your local machine.

### Installation
The easiest way to see how this works is to launch the app instantly using Docker:
1. Download the `docker-compose.yml` file provided in the repository.
2. Open your terminal, navigate to the folder containing the file, and run:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
3. Docker will automatically download the correct version of MySQL, initialize the database schema, install the Java dependencies, and launch the application.
